# Agile in Machine Learning

The following article discusses the role of Agile in machine learning projects: https://towardsdatascience.com/when-agile-meets-machine-learning-2af111bddeec

As Machine learning is on the rise and nearly every industry is trying to use machine learning in their products and business. I thought it would be interesting to see how agile practices are being applied to data science and machine learning.

There are some differences between using agile development conventional products to using agile in machine learning products. Since Agile focuses on certain quality and correctness metrics for each sprint and ensures deliverable features are deployed. This may not be the case for machine learning projects.

Since data science and machine learning are usually more research intensive, the knowledge which is required for building a feature is initially absent as well as the exact deliverables. For example, we might not want a ML model accuracy of 95% but this is at best a theoretical concept as it cannot be deterministically proven. Furthermore, it could be seen that even with an "accuracy" of 85%, the model is good enough to generate business value. Does this qualify as a deliverable?

I would like to know your thoughts.

Joshua Habif - Interesting article. A first step to the solution to the problem which you pose is defining rigorious metrics on what is "accuracy." Once this term is defined, we can define a metric that measures the accuracy of the model, and, in turn, choose a quantity below which the model does not meet the expectations.   

# Aaron's Comment:
I thought a very interesting point the author raised was to "build heterogeneous teams." We might assume that a research team should be compromised of all researchers, however, the author discusses how it is important to have the opposite. Developers and product reps should be part of the team as well because they will have to implement the features that researchers find to be the most beneficial.
