# Agile in Machine Learning

The following article discusses the role of Agile in machine learning projects: https://towardsdatascience.com/when-agile-meets-machine-learning-2af111bddeec

As Machine learning is on the rise and nearly every industry is trying to use machine learning in their products and business. I thought it would be interesting to see how agile practices are being applied to data science and machine learning.

There are some differences between using agile development conventional products to using agile in machine learning products. Since Agile focuses on certain quality and correctness metrics for each sprint and ensures deliverable features are deployed. This may not be the case for machine learning projects.

Since data science and machine learning are usually more research intensive, the knowledge which is required for building a feature is initially absent as well as the exact deliverables. For example, we might not want a ML model accuracy of 95% but this is at best a theoretical concept as it cannot be deterministically proven. Furthermore, it could be seen that even with an "accuracy" of 85%, the model is good enough to generate business value. Does this qualify as a deliverable?

I would like to know your thoughts.

Yena Park (yp1071): Thanks for sharing this article! I thought it was interesting that while there are challenges to implemeting agile methodologies in machine learning (such as the question of optimization vs delivering a working product, and determining what "working" even means) there are some practices that seem to work well especially for research-intensive environments, e.g. the retrospective, which allows teams to continuously evaluate and priorize their work -- this seems all the more important when the exact outcome is unpredictable.
